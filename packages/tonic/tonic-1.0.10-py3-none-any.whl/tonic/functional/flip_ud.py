    Flips events and images in y. Pixels map as:

        events: ndarray of shape [num_events, num_event_channels]
        images: ndarray of these possible shapes:

        sensor_size: size of the sensor that was used [W,H]
        ordering: ordering of the event tuple inside of events. This function requires 'x'
                  to be in the ordering
        flip_probability: probability of performing the flip
        multi_image: Fix whether or not the first dimension of images is num_images

    Returns:
        - returns every event with y' = (sensor_size[1] - 1) - y
