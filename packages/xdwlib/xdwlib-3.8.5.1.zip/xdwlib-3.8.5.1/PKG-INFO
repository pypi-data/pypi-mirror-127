        Installation
        ============
        
        System Requirements
        -------------------
        
            - Microsoft Windows (versions compatible with DocuWorks 7 and 8)
        
            - Python 3.7+
        
            - DocuWorks 7.0+ (Japanese version; English version is not tested)
        
        Install from archive
        --------------------
        
        Set PATH environment variable properly and issue the following command::
        
            python3 setup.py install
        
        This will install xdwlib in $PYTHONPATH/xdwlib.
        
        Install from PyPI
        -----------------
        
        Xdwlib is also delivered via Python Package Index (PyPI).  The latest
        version of xdwlib will be installed by issuing::
        
            pip3 install xdwlib
        
        If you have installed older version of xdwlib already, try::
        
            pip3 install --upgrade xdwlib
        
        Optional Modules
        ----------------
        
        PIL (Python Imaging Library)
        ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
        
        Xdwlib has been working with PIL (Python Imaging Library) if available,
        to rotate pages for desired degrees other than right angles, and to copy
        bitmap annotations.  Unfortunately the original PIL has not been ported
        on Python 3 yet.
        
        There is an alternative library called `Pillow` which will be a good
        substitution.  Install Pillow by issuing::
        
            pip3 install pillow
        
        cx_Freeze
        '''''''''
        
        The attached command line tool ``xdw2text.py`` can be compiled to .exe
        with cx_Freeze package, a popular successor of py2exe.  To build your
        own ``xdw2text.exe``, try::
        
            pip3 install cx_Freeze
            python3 setup.py build
        
        
        Typical Use
        ===========
        
        The following code will appy OCR and paste a date stamp on every page
        as an annotation::
        
            import time
        
            from xdwlib import xdwopen, Point
        
            ...
        
            with xdwopen(PATHNAME, autosave=True) as doc:
                position = Point(pg.size - 100, pg.size - 20)
                datestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
                for pg in doc:
                    pg.rotate(auto=True)
                    pg.ocr(strategy="accuracy")
                    ann = pg.add_text(position=position, text=datestamp)
                    ann.fore_color = "red"
