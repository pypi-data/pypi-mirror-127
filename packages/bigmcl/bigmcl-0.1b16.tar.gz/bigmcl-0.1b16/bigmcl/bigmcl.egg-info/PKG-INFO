Description: # bigmcl
        
        High throughput large scale Markov clustering (MCL) via subgraph extraction    
        bigmcl will isolate disconnected subgraphs from a large graph file and perform
        Markov clustering on the subgraphs. bigmcl enables MCL on large, highly 
        disconnected graphs, such as those used in orthogroup inference.
