Global Chem is a variable store for common and rare chemical lists using IUPAC as input and SMILES/SMARTS as output. As 
mostly needed by myself as I search through chemical infinity. 

I have found these lists written history to be useful, they come from a variety of different fields but are aggregated 
into the most common format of organic chemists (IUPAC) and the common language of the cheminformatician (SMILES) and for 
pattern matching (SMARTS).

Using GlobalChem
=====================

GlobalChem, initially, is one class object that have a fixed set of variables. Eventually and hopefully as the package 
grows it will be abstracted out by field i.e protein chemistry, analytical, and so on. 

Installation 
============

GlobalChem is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
it yourself.

```

pip install global-chem

```
Quick Start
===========

Just with no dependencies, intialize the class and there you go! All the common and rare groups of the world
at your disposal 

```

from global_chem import GlobalChem

global_chem = GlobalChem()

compounds = global_chem.rings_in_drugs_smiles
```

Genesis
=======

GlobalChem was created because I noticed I was using the same variable across multiple scripts and figure it would be useful
for folk to have.
