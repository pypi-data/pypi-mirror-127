Description: # Craft Parts
        
        Craft-parts provides a mechanism to obtain data from different sources,
        process it in various ways, and prepare a filesystem subtree suitable for
        deployment. The components used in its project specification are called
        *parts*, which can be independently downloaded, built and installed, and
        also depend on each other in order to assemble the subtree containing the
        final artifacts.
