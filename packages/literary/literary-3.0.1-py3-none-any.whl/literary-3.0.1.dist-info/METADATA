## TL;DR
Literary is a Python tool to make Jupyter (IPython) notebooks behave like pure-Python packages. This allows pure-Python packages to be generated from notebooks, and notebooks to be imported at runtime. Literary now [bootstraps itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping); it is developed with Literary ðŸ¤¯.

This package is an exploration of the [literate programming](http://www.literateprogramming.com) idea [pioneered by
 Donald
Knuth](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/lp.html) and implemented in the
 [`nbdev` package](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev). Although `nbdev` looks to be a very
mature and comprehensive tool, it resembles a significant departure from conventional package development. Literary is an
exploration of what a smaller `nbdev` might look like.

## Philosophy ðŸ“–
1. **Low mental overhead**   
 Realistically, most Python programmers that wish to write packages need to have some
 familiarity with the Python package development model, including the conventional
structure of a package. For this reason, I feel that it is important to design
`literary` such that these skills translate directly to designing libraries with
notebooks
2. **Minimal downstream impact**  
 Users of `literary` packages should not realise that they are consuming 
 notebook-generated code at runtime. This means that a pure-Python package needs to
 be generated from the notebooks, and it must use the conventional import model. For
 this reason, `literary` should only exist as a development dependency of
 the package.
