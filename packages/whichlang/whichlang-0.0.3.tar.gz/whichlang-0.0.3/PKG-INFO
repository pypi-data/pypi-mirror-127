# whichlang

whichlang is a Python library for identifying the language of the given text

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install whichlang.

```bash
pip install whichlang
```

## Usage

```python
import whichlang
from whichlang import which_lang

f = open('sample-test-files\\sample-hindi.txt','r')
data = f.read()

# returns tuple of top 3 probable languages, first one being most probable language
print (which_lang(data))
>>> ('Hindi', 'Marathi', 'Punjabi') #Hindi is most probable. 
```

```
# For training a language model
# assamese.txt is train data
# Assamese is the language model created
python train_lang_models.py -f train-data\as\assamese.txt -l Assamese
```

2. whichlang is based on N-gram based Text categorization: Cavnar, William B., and John M. Trenkle. "N-gram-based text categorization." Proceedings of   SDAIR-94, 3rd annual symposium on document analysis and information retrieval. Vol. 161175. 1994.
 The same approach was used in library [langdetect]((https://github.com/fedelopez77/langdetect)). We found this approach quite effective and wanted to explore for Indian languages. In whichlang, we train, optimize and make  models readily available for Indian languages since these languages have been less explored.
