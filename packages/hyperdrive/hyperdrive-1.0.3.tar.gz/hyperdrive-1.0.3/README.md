<!-- need to create an oracle -->
<!-- extra -->
<!-- 3. auto update model monthly -->
<!-- abstract away undersample fx from preprocess fx, and buy and sell from order fx, make oracle class -->
<!-- 4. automate saving model and preprocessors (every 2 weeks ) -->
<!-- 5. add live results on website / model vs buying and holding like alphahub - use dash or plotly? use pca visualization, tsne for higher dimensions, roc curve, etc-->
<!-- 6. add authentication and business like report style like in dash example -->
