class ScopeMap(Generic[KT, VT]):
    """Mapping-like structure to hold binds and cached values.

    The important aspect of this is that we may have thousands of dependencies, but generally only a couple (<10) scopes.
    So this is designed to operate in ~ O(S) time, where S is the number of scopes.
    Imporantly, when we enter or exit a scope (which can happen very frequently, e.g. requests in a web framework),
    no iteration is required: we can simply pop all keys in that scope.

    The interface is *almost* a Mapping[KT, VT] but not quite: some operations like set / __setitem__ require a key, a value *and* a scope.
    We could implement ScopeMap[key, scope] = value, but that can lead to a bit of confusion since we want lookups like ScopMap[key].
    Additionally, operations are not O(1) but rather O(S).
    So we choose to use method names like get() and set() to deal with the API differences and indicate that operations are more expensive than O(1).
    This is also similar to collections.ChainMap, except that we want "named" nodes (Scopes) and ChainMap uses a plain list.
    ChainMap also doesn't allow you to set values anywhere but the left mapping, and we need to set values in arbitrary mappings.
