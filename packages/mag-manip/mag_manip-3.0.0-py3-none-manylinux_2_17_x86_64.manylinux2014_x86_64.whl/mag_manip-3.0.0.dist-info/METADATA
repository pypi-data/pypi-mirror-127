    mag_manip is a toolbox for remote magnetic navigation applications. Mag_manip models the behavior of
    electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS), particularly the relationship between the electrical currents running
    through electromagnets and the resulting magnetic field that is generated in the workspace. The toolbox is
    implemented in C++11, with extensions to Python.
