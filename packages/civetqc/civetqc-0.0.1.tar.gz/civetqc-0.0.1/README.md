# CivetQC

## About

Although the CIVET Cortical Surface Extraction Pipeline provides users with extensive data for quality control purposes, reviewing these data manually is time consuming and impractical when dealing with extremely large datasets. CivetQC is a fully automated quality control pipeline for CIVET outputs based on the random forest algorithm. Using data from our lab (N=1087), the algorithm was trained to classify CIVET outputs as either unacceptable (0) or acceptable (1). Although CivetQC is still in development, it can currently detect unacceptable outputs with an accuracy of approximately 85%.
