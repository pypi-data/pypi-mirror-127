   ⋅- [I] tags
   ⋅
   ⋅    Beside "abbreviation" and "flags", other tags may be added:

   ⋅      :new_tag: key
   ⋅      :new_tag: key : content
   ⋅
   ⋅    Please note that the "content" part is optional.
   ⋅
   ⋅    You may reduce authorized tags to zero tag:
   ⋅      %%authorised tags(json)"%%[]
   ⋅    Be careful since the syntax is tricky. See [K] section of this document.
   ⋅
   ⋅- [J] variables
   ⋅
   ⋅    Variables may contain a (str)value:
   ⋅
   ⋅        /context/ 123
   ⋅
   ⋅    .read_variables["context"] will contain ((str)"123", fals)
   ⋅
   ⋅    Variable names DO NOT contain spaces; variable value may
   ⋅    contain any character:
   ⋅
   ⋅       /my_variable/ value with spaces and /special/ characters
   ⋅
   ⋅    fals contains the informations about the last initialization of
   ⋅    the variable.
   ⋅
   ⋅- [K] parsing tools redefinition:
   ⋅    Simple tags expecting a string:
   ⋅    - %%comment_lineprefix%%#
   ⋅    - %%tobecontinued_char%%⬂
   ⋅    - %%filetobeincluded_lineprefix%%
   ⋅
   ⋅    Tag expecting a json-boolean that will be json.loads():
   ⋅    - %%allow_leftspaces_syntax(json)%%True
   ⋅      or
   ⋅      %%allow_leftspaces_syntax(json)%%False
   ⋅
   ⋅    Tag expecting a json-list of strings that will be json.loads():
   ⋅    - %%authorised tags(json)"%%["abbreviation"]
   ⋅      or
   ⋅      %%authorised tags(json)"%%["abbreviation", "flag"]
   ⋅
   ⋅        !!! Beware: DO NOT WRITE
   ⋅        !!!   %%authorised tags(json)"%%["abbreviation", "flag",]
   ⋅        !!! with a last comma ! json.loads() can't interpret such a string
   ⋅        !!! Write instead:
   ⋅        !!!   %%authorised tags(json)"%%["abbreviation", "flag"]
   ⋅
   ⋅    Tag expecting a json-string that will be re.compile'd():
   ⋅    - %%tag_kv(regex)%%^\:(?P<name>[^:]+)\:
   ⋅      \s*(?P<key>[^\s]*)\s*\(:\s*(?P<value>[^\s]*))?$
   ⋅
   ⋅      This regex needs 3 groups : 'name', 'key', 'value'. (see ETR-ERRORID012)
   ⋅
   ⋅                            → see ETR.parsingtools["parsingtools_definition(regex)"]
   ⋅
   ⋅- [L] parsing tool regex redefinition:
   ⋅
   ⋅      %%parsingtools_definition(regex)%%°°(?P<name>[^:]+)°°(?P<value>.+)
   ⋅
   ⋅      This regex needs 2 groups : 'name', 'value'. (see ETR-ERRORID011)
   ⋅
   ⋅      so that you may write:
   ⋅      °°comment_lineprefix°°|||
