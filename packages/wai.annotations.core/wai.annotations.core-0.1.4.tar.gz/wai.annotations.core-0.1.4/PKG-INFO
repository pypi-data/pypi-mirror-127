        0.1.4 (2021-11-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Added ISP for discarding polygons that either have too few or too many points (`polygon-discarder`)
        - Added `--verbose` flag to `dimension-discarder` ISP for outputting information when an annotation
          gets discarded.

        -------------------

          by looking for single/majority objects/labels.
        
        0.1.2 (2021-06-01)
        -------------------
