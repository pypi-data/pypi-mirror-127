- [Server](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/) - the Faktory daemon which stores background jobs in queues to be processed by Workers.
- Client - an entity that communicates with the Faktory server using the [FWP](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/blob/master/docs/protocol-specification.md). A single client can act as both a consumer and a producer.
- Consumer (or Worker) - a client that fetches work units (jobs) from the server for execution.
- Producer - a client that issues new work units to the server.

This library tries to implement the [FWP](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/blob/master/docs/protocol-specification.md) as well as possible. If you notice any inconsistencies, please report them.

## Installation

```
pip install pyfaktory
```

## Usage

### Faktory Server

If you have a Faktory server already running, make sure you have the correct url.

```python
# Default url for a Faktory server running locally
faktory_server_url = 'tcp://localhost:7419'
```

For the installation of faktory, please refer to [the official documentation](https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/wiki/Installation).

After installation, you can run it locally.

```console
$ /usr/bin/faktory
Faktory 1.5.2
Copyright Â© 2021 Contributed Systems LLC
Licensed under the GNU Affero Public License 3.0
I 2021-08-30T06:58:37.050Z Initializing redis storage at /home/albatros/.faktory/db, socket /home/albatros/.faktory/db/redis.sock
I 2021-08-30T06:58:37.061Z Web server now listening at localhost:7420
I 2021-08-30T06:58:37.061Z PID 23549 listening at localhost:7419, press Ctrl-C to stop
```

You can use a password for the Faktory server via the environment variable `FAKTORY_PASSWORD`. Note if this value starts with a `/`, then it is considered a pointer to a file on the filesystem with the password. By default `/etc/faktory/password` is used.

The format of the Faktory URL is as follows:
```
tcp://:password@localhost:7419
```

To run Faktory in production:
```
/usr/bin/faktory -e production
```

Faktory in production mode requires a password by default since version 0.7.0.

### Faktory Client

Import `pyfaktory`.

```python
from pyfaktory import Client, Consumer, Producer
```

A single client can act as both a consumer and a producer.

```python
client = Client(faktory_url='tcp://localhost:7419')
client.connect()
# Now you can use the client
# At the end, diconnect the client
client.disconnect()
```

Client is a context manager, so you can use `with` statement.

```python
with Client(faktory_url='tcp://localhost:7419') as client:
    # Use client
```

Use `role` argument to say how you want to use the client. This argument has 
three possible values: 'consumer', 'producer' or 'both'.

```python
# A client that acts as both a consumer and a producer.
client = Client(faktory_url='tcp://localhost:7419', role='both')
```

### Producer

Use the client to push jobs.

```python
with Client(faktory_url='tcp://localhost:7419', role='producer') as client:
    producer = Producer(client=client)
    producer.push_job(jobtype='adder', args=(5, 4))
```

### Consumer (Worker)

Use a worker to pull jobs from Faktory server and execute them.

```python
def adder(x, y):
    logging.info(f"{x} + {y} = {x + y}")

with Client(faktory_url='tcp://localhost:7419', role='consumer') as client:
    consumer = Consumer(client=client, queues=['default'], concurrency=1)
    consumer.register('adder', adder)
    consumer.run()
```

Use `priority` to indicates in which queue order the jobs should be fetched 
first.

```python
# With strict priority, there is a risk of starvation
consumer = Consumer(client=client, queues=['critical', 'default', 'bulk'], priority='strict')
# Each queue has an equal chance of being fetched first
consumer = Consumer(client=client, queues=['critical', 'default', 'bulk'], priority='uniform')
# Weights must be specified
consumer = Consumer(client=client, queues=['critical', 'default', 'bulk'], priority='weighted', weights=[0.6, 0.3, 0.1])
```

### Capture exceptions using Sentry

To capture exceptions using Sentry before failling jobs 
set `sentry_capture_exception` argument to `True`.

```python
consumer = Consumer(client=client, sentry_capture_exception=True)
```

## Example

Find examples in `./examples`.

- Start the Faktory server.
```
/usr/bin/faktory
```

- Launch a producer.
```
python examples/fproducer.py
```

- Launch a consumer.
```
python examples/fconsumer.py
```

- Look at what is happening in the logs and in the [Faktory Web UI](http://localhost:7420/).

### Issues

If you encounter a problem, please report it.

In addition to the description of your problem, report the server and client
versions.

```python
pyfaktory.__version__
```
```
/usr/bin/faktory -v
```

Reproduce your problem while increasing the level of debugging for both the
server and the client, and report the logs.
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s %(levelname)-8s %(message)s',
                    level=logging.DEBUG,
                    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
```
```
/usr/bin/faktory -l debug
```
