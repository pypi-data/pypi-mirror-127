### Context
* Created: November 2021

### Description
A python project that enables interaction with the GitHub API v3 to e.g. read/download files from the 
github organisation [hdsr-mid]. This project uses the github account [HdsrMidReadOnly], that has read-only access 
to some of the [hdsr-mid] repos. This organisation requires 2FA, so authentication - via github api - is only 
possible with a personal access token. For this account the following yields:
- A personal access token has been created which is required for the Github API
- The token has no expiration date
- To [change personal access token] for account HdsrMidReadOnly 
    - login github.com with account HdsrMidReadOnly
        - email: hdsrmidgithub@gmail.com
        - password: please contact renier.kramer@hdsr.nl
    - go to settings >> developer settings >> personal access token >> generate new token
-  To change authorization for account HdsrMidReadOnly
   - get admin rights for [hdsr-mid]
   - go to [authorisation page]

### Usage (simple)
```
pip install hdsr-pygithub
from hdsr_pygithub import GithubFileDownloader
from pathlib import Path

github_downloader = GithubFileDownloader(
    repo_name="startenddate",                                               # any hdsr-mid repo for which account HdsrMidReadOnly has access (see README.md)
    target_file=Path("data/output/results/mwm_peilschalen_short.csv"),      # this file must exist in the master branch
)
download_url = github_downloader.target_file_content.download_url
dataframe_file = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer=download_url)
```
### Usage (sophisticated)
```
pip install hdsr-pygithub
from hdsr_pygithub import GithubFileDownloader
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

github_downloader = GithubFileDownloader(
    repo_name="startenddate",                                               # any hdsr-mid repo for which account HdsrMidReadOnly has access (see README.md)
    target_file=Path("data/output/results/mwm_peilschalen_short.csv"),      # this file must exist in the master branch
    target_file_allowed_period_no_updates=datetime.timedelta(weeks=52 * 5), # defaults to 1 year
    personal_access_token=<personal_access_token>,                          # you can use your own github account's token
    repo_organisation='hdsr-mid',                                           # defaults to 'hdsr-mid'
)
download_url = github_downloader.target_file_content.download_url
dataframe_file = pd.read_csv(filepath_or_buffer=download_url)

NOTE: usually, 3 ways exists to login with GitHub API:
    1) Github(login_or_token=<user>, password=<pass>)
    2) Github(login_or_token=<personal_access_token>)
    3) Github(base_url="https://{hostname}/api/v3", login_or_token=<personal_access_token>)
However, the first is not possible for github organisation 'hdsr-mid' as since 13 sep 2021, that repo requires
two-factor authentication for everyone in the hdsr-mid organization: login trough github api is now only possible
with token (options 1 and 2). In this project we use option 2.

### Conda general tips
#### Build conda environment (on Windows) from any directory using environment.yml:
```
> conda env create --name <conda_env_name> --file <path_to_project>/environment.yml python=<python_version>
> conda info --envs  # verify that <conda_env_name> is in this list 
```
#### Start the application from any directory:
```
> conda activate <conda_env_name>
At any location:
> (<conda_env_name>) python <path_to_project>/main.py
```
#### Test the application:
```
> conda activate <conda_env_name>
> cd <path_to_project>
> pytest  # make sure pytest is installed (conda install pytest)
```
#### List all conda environments on your machine:
```
At any location:
> conda info --envs
```
#### Delete a conda environment:
```
Get directory where environment is located 
> conda info --envs
Remove the enviroment
> conda env remove --name <conda_env_name>
Finally, remove the left-over directory by hand
```
#### Write dependencies to environment.yml:
The goal is to keep the .yml as short as possible (not include sub-dependencies), yet make the environment 
reproducible. Why? If you do 'conda install matplotlib' you also install sub-dependencies like pyqt, qt 
icu, and sip. You should not include these sub-dependencies in your .yml as:
- including sub-dependencies result in an unnecessary strict environment (difficult to solve when conflicting)
- sub-dependencies will be installed when dependencies are being installed
```
> conda activate <conda_env_name>

Recommended:
> conda env export --from-history --no-builds | findstr -v "prefix" > --file <path_to_project>/environment_new.yml   

Alternative:
> conda env export --no-builds | findstr -v "prefix" > --file <path_to_project>/environment_new.yml 

--from-history: 
    Only include packages that you have explicitly asked for, as opposed to including every package in the 
    environment. This flag works regardless how you created the environment (through CMD or Anaconda Navigator).
--no-builds:
    By default, the YAML includes platform-specific build constraints. If you transfer across platforms (e.g. 
    win32 to 64) omit the build info with '--no-builds'.
```
#### Pip and Conda:
If a package is not available on all conda channels, but available as pip package, one can install pip as a dependency.
Note that mixing packages from conda and pip is always a potential problem: conda calls pip, but pip does not know 
how to satisfy missing dependencies with packages from Anaconda repositories. 
```
> conda activate <conda_env_name>
> conda install pip
> pip install <pip_package>
```
The environment.yml might look like:
```
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - <a conda package>=<version>
  - pip
  - pip:
    - <a pip package>==<version>
```
You can also write a requirements.txt file:
```
> pip list --format=freeze > <path_to_project>/requirements.txt
```
