# pyOnvista
A tiny API for onvista.de financial website.

The API provides at a maximum all available chart data as can be viewed on the webpage.

The API core uses package requests to download contents.
The implementation of requests is very flat without deeper exception handling.

It uses the super fast lxml binding to C libxml2 and libxslt instead of beautiful soup
for html parsing. xpath are hardcoded but may be user defined at a later stage.


## Installation:
    pip install pyOnvista

## Please note:
The API fakes a request from a normal chart subpages. Therefore, it may not be recognized by the server.
However, there may be a misalignment between notification_id and exchange (market). Because not all
acronyms are provided yet or proper. See also markets.json.
The API does not validate the market opening times as provided by onvista and market

The server may mind the scrapping action when frequencies is high. It is recommended
to use a rotating proxy, or at least rotate user agent and let pass plenty of time.
Please keep also terms of webpage company in mind. This script may harm the terms.

## Usage:
Preliminary you need to know the ISIN of the instrument.
Create an instrument and request quote data by calling .get_quotes

    from pyOnvista import Instrument, Request
    
    # make a configured request. Provide a proper header
    user_agent = "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0"
    header = {'user-agent': user_agent}
    request = Request(header=header)
    
    # make the instrument you wish
    vw = Instrument("DE0007664039", request)
    
    # request quotes
    quotes = vw.get_quotes("month")  # retrieve quotes from default market
    
    # and do some stuff
    for quote in quotes:
        print(quote.timestamp.isoformat(), " high: ", quote.high, " low: ", quote.low)
