    Class that handles the advising of an execution.

    A `Session` object is given to the individual advices that are called to advise
    the execution. By calling the appropriate methods like `def proceed(self)` to
    continue or `conclude()` to end with a result, the advices can influence the final
    result.
    Additionally, the session provides access to the `context`, which allows advices
    to keep state, the `execution` that is advised, the `configuration` that is used
    for advising and the `result` of the execution.

    Attributes:
        task (bandsaw.tasks.Task): The task that is executed.
        execution (bandsaw.execution.Execution): The execution arguments for the task.
        context (bandsaw.context.Context): The context that can be used for advices
            to store state.
