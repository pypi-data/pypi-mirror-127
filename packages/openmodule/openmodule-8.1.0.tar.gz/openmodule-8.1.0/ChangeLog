CHANGES
=======

v8.1.0
------

* changelog and breaking changes updated
* \* Adds an IO Listener \* Adds a SigTERM interrupt handler which converts to KeyboardInterrupt so shutdown in Docker containers is easier \* The main Test Mixin was refactored to start a separate process and raise a Interrupt. The other test methods were removed due to being hacky and crashing tox/pytest from time to time. Since this only breaks test code we don't bump the major version. \* The openmodule now waits for a connection with the message broker on startup \* Fixes an issue in the RPCServerTestMixin
