    "Aside from the language model you build from the dataset used, the algorithm has a functionality of a cache model. This can be created progressively from the choices the user makes and the sentences they build while using the base model. The cache model will complement the base model to adapt the predictions to each user in particular, while still using the same base model.\n",
