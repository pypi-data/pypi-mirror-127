    "This algorithm would be pointless if there's not some kind of interactive way of making predictions, letting the user choose which path they would like to go for and feed the new sentence back to the model in a loop for as long as the user wants. Since this interaction will change based on the app the algorithm is implemented in, we only added a basic example of an interactive predictor that you can play around with and maybe get inspired to build your own.\n",
