        The HSE KVDB attempts to maintain reasonable QoS and for high-throughput

        For some kinds of data (e.g., control metadata) the client may wish to not

        Non-transactional cursors:

        If ``txn`` is None, a non-transactional cursor is created. Non-transactional
        cursors have an ephemeral snapshot view of the KVS at the time it the cursor
        is created. The snapshot view is maintained for the life of the cursor.
        Writes to the KVS (put, deletes, etc.) made after the cursor is created will
        not be visible to the cursor unless ``KvsCursor.update_view()`` is used to
        obtain a more recent snapshot view. Non-transactional cursors can be used on
        transactional and non-transactional KVSs.

        Transactional cursors:

        If ``txn`` is not None, it must be a valid transaction handle or undefined
        behavior will result. If it is a valid handle to a transaction in the ACTIVE
        state, a transactional cursor is created. A transaction cursor's view
        includes the transaction's writes overlaid on the transaction's ephemeral
        snapshot view of the KVS. If the transaction is committed or aborted before
        the cursor is destroyed, the cursor's view reverts to same snaphsot view the
        transaction had when first became active. The cursor will no longer be able
        to see the transaction's writes. Calling ``KvsCursor.update_view()`` on a
        transactional cursor is a no-op and has no effect on the cursor's view.
        Transactional cursors can only be used on transactional KVSs.

        Prefix vs non-prefix cursors:

        Parameter ``filter`` can be used to iterate over the subset
        of keys in the KVS whose first ``len(filter)`` bytes match the first
        ``len(filter)`` bytes pointed to by ``filter``.

        A prefix cursor is created when:
            * KVS was created with ``prefix.length`` > 0 (i.e., it is a prefix KVS), and
            * ``filter`` != None and ``len(filter)`` >= ``prefix.length``.

        Otherwise, a non-prefix cursor is created.

        Applications should arrange their key-value data to avoid the need for
        non-prefix cursors as they are significantly slower and more
        resource-intensive than prefix cursors. Note that simply using a filter
        doesn't create a prefix cursor -- it must meet the two conditions listed
        above.

        This function is thread safe across disparate cursors.

        Args:

class KvdbTransaction:
    """
    The HSE KVDB provides transactions with operations spanning KVSs within a
    single KVDB. These transactions have snapshot isolation (a specific form of
    MVCC) with the normal semantics (see "Concurrency Control and Recovery in
    Database Systems" by PA Bernstein).

    One unusual aspect of the API as it relates to transactions is that the data
    object that is used to hold client-level transaction state is allocated
    separately from the transaction being initiated. As a result, the same object
    handle should be reused again and again.

    In addition, there is very limited coupling between threading and
    transactions. A single thread may have many transactions in flight
    simultaneously. Also operations within a transaction can be performed by
    multiple threads. The latter mode of operation must currently restrict calls
    so that only one thread is actively performing an operation in the context of
    a particular transaction at any particular time.

    The general lifecycle of a transaction is as follows:

                          +----------+
                          | INVALID  |
                          +----------+
                                |
                                v
                          +----------+
        +---------------->|  ACTIVE  |<----------------+
        |                 +----------+                 |
        |  +-----------+    |      |     +----------+  |
        +--| COMMITTED |<---+      +---->| ABORTED  |--+
           +-----------+                 +----------+

    When a transaction is initially allocated, it starts in the INVALID state.
    When ``KvdbTransaction.begin()`` is called with transaction in the INVALID,
    COMMITTED, or ABORTED states, it moves to the ACTIVE state. It is an error to
    call the hse_kvdb_txn_begin() function on a transaction in the ACTIVE state.
    For a transaction in the ACTIVE state, only the functions
    ``KvdbTransaction.commit()`` or``KvdbTransaction.abort()`` may be
    called.

    When a transaction becomes ACTIVE, it establishes an ephemeral snapshot view
    of the state of the KVDB. Any data mutations outside of the transaction's
    context after that point are not visible to the transaction. Similarly, any
    mutations performed within the context of the transaction are not visible
    outside of the transaction unless and until it is committed. All such
    mutations become visible atomically when the transaction commits.

    Within a transaction whenever a write operation e.g., put, delete, etc.,
    encounters a write conflict, that operation returns an error code of
    ECANCELED. The caller is then expected to re-try the operation in a new
    transaction, see ``HseException``.
