Description: thorlabs_mc2000b
        ================
        
        This is an interface to the Thorlabs MC2000B optical chopper unit, communicating over the USB
        serial port.
        
        Usage is quite straightforward. For example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from thorlabs_mc2000b import MC2000B, Blade
            # Initialise the first detected device
            chopper = MC2000B()
            # We'll assume the default MC1F10HP is installed
            print(chopper.get_blade_string())
            # Set up to use external reference source and the inner part of the blade
            chopper.set_inref_string("external-inner")
            # Apply a 1/2 divider to the input frequency
            chopper.nharmonic = 1
            chopper.dharmonic = 2
            # Start it up!
            chopper.enable = True
        
            # If a different chopper blade is installed, it can be configured by
            # using the Blade enum, for example for the MC1F60 model:
            chopper.blade = Blade.MC1F60
            # This may change the available input and/or output reference sources.
            # To check which are available for a blade model:
            print(Blade.MC1F60.inrefs)
            print(Blade.MC1F60.outrefs)
        
        
        Information about the unit can be found on the `product webpage <https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=287>`_,
        and details of the commands and how they apply to the different models of chopper blades can be
        found in the `user manual <https://www.thorlabs.com/_sd.cfm?fileName=TTN102010-D02.pdf&partNumber=MC2000B-EC>`_.
