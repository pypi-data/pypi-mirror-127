        A plugin to export books to github
        
        **This plugin is currently in early-stage development. It has not reached production level quality yet.**
        
        To install:
        
        1. Make sure you have installed the `fiduswriter-books` plugin and you have updated both `fiduswriter` and `fiduswriter-books` to the latest 3.9.x patch release.
        
        2. Install this plugin (for example by running ``pip install fiduswriter-github-export``).
        
        3. In your configuration.py file, add "github_export" and "allauth.socialaccount.providers.github" to ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
        
        4. Set up github as one of the connected login options. See instructions here: https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers.html#github . The callback URL will be in the format https://DOMAIN.NAME/api/github/github/login/callback/
        
        5. In your configuration.py file, make sure to add repo rights for the github connector like this::
        
            SOCIALACCOUNT_PROVIDERS = {
                'github': {
                    'SCOPE': [
                        'repo',
                        'user:email',
                    ],
                }
            }
        
        To use:
        
        1. Login to your Fidus Writer instance using github, or login with a regular account and connect a Github account on the profile page (https://DOMAIN.NAME/user/profile/)
        
        2. Go to the books overview page.
        
        3. Enter a book to set the github settings for the book.
        
        4. Select the book in the overview and export to github via the dropdown menu.
