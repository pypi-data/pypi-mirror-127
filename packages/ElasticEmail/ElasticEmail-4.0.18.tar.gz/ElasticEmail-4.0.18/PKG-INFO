    This API is based on the REST API architecture, allowing the user to easily manage their data with this resource-based approach.    Every API call is established on which specific request type (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) will be used.    The API has a limit of 20 concurrent connections and a hard timeout of 600 seconds per request.    To start using this API, you will need your Access Token (available &lt;a target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot; href&#x3D;\&quot;https://elasticemail.com/account#/settings/new/manage-api\&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Remember to keep it safe. Required access levels are listed in the given request’s description.    This is the documentation for REST API.
