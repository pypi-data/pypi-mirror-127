Update DELAY_INTERVAL for changes in fetch sensitivity

The lower the number, the greater the amount of fetches within a minute but
an increasd amount of potential issues. 

The larger the number, the lower the amount of fetches within a minute but 
a decreased amount of potential issues.

Defaults to 1 minute
```python
DELAY_INTERVAL = 60
```


When creating a Put, it will check to see if the destination file already exists. If a file is already in the directory 
then it will append the next subsequent letter to the file name.
This will fail if there are more than 10 instances of a file in the same directory
```python
while os.path.exists(path):
    if path[-1] in self.APPENDS:
        path = path[:len(path)-1] + self.APPENDS[count]
    else:
        path = path + self.APPENDS[count]
    count +=1
return path
```

## How to use
