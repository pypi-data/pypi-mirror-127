Description: # pdf-renamer
        pdf-renamer is a Python command-line tool to automatically rename the pdf files of a scientific paper, or in general any publication which can be associated to a [DOI](http://dx.doi.org) or
        other identifiers (e.g. [arXiv](https://arxiv.org)). It can be used to rename single files or to scan entire folders and sub-folders.
        The format of the filename can be specified by the user by choosing among several tags. Besides command-line operation, it can also be used as a library
        from your Python project.

        ## Description
        ```pdf-renamer``` uses the libraries [pdf2doi](https://github.com/MicheleCotrufo/pdf2doi) and [pdf2bib](https://github.com/MicheleCotrufo/pdf2bib) to extract 
        bibliographic data of a paper starting from a .pdf file. The retrieved data can then be used to automatically rename pdf files with a custom format (e.g. 'Year - Journal - Authors - Title').
        
        ## Installation
        
        [![Pip Package](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pdf-renamer?logo=PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pdf-renamer)
        
        Use the package manager pip to install pdf-renamer.
        
        ```bash
        pip install pdfrenamer==1.0rc1
        ```
        The executable will be installed in certain directory whose path depends on the type of Python installation and the operating system. Make sure that this directory is in the ```PATH``` variable of your operating system (for standard python installations under Windows this should be already the case). Check how to do add the folder to the ```PATH``` variable for [Windows](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+add+script+folder+to+path+windows), [Mac](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+add+script+folder+to+path+mac) and [Linux](https://www.google.com/search?q=python+add+script+folder+to+path+linux).
        
        Under Windows, it is also possible to add [shortcuts to the right-click context menu](#installing-the-shortcuts-in-the-right-click-context-menu-of-windows).
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```pdf-renamer``` can be invoked directly from the command line, without having to open a python console.
        The simplest command-line invokation is
        
        ```
        $ pdfrenamer 'path/to/target'
        ```
        where ```target``` is either a valid pdf file or a directory containing pdf files.
        
        Type
        
        ```
        $ pdfrenamer --h
        ```
        
        for a list of all the possible optional commands.
