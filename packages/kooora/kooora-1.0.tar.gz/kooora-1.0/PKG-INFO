[Kooora](kooora.com) unofficial Python API.

## Installation
`pip3 install kooora`

## Current features
* Search by keyword (leagues, teams, players)
* Fetch matches by
    * Date

## Examples

Below are some basic examples to use the library:

### Initialize Kooora class
```python
from kooora.kooora import *
api = Kooora()
```

### Get the names of the leagues being played today
```python
today_matches = api.get_today_matches()
# today_matches is a dict which keys are league ID numbers, let's extract the IDs
*today_matches_ids, = today_matches
for id in today_matches_ids[]:
    print(League.from_id(id).get_title())
```

### Get matches being played today in a given league (example with spanish liga)
```python
for match in today_matches[22393]:
    print(match)
```

### Fetch stats for a given match
```python
yesterday = api.get_yesterday_matches()[22495].get_stats()
```

### Initialize a League variable by ID and fetch its ranking and top scorers
```python
liga = League.from_id(22393) # you can also use api.search
liga_table = liga.get_table()
top_scorers = liga.get_top_scorers()
```

### Find a team by its name and fetch its next match
```python
eibar = None
for t in liga.get_teams():
    if t.get_name() == "إيبار":
        eibar = t
        break
```

## Contributing
The project is still at a very early stage.
See https://github.com/marrakchino/kooora-unofficial-api/projects/1 for a list 
of ideas or kindly open an issue to raise a bug or submit a feature request.

## Idea 
I've been fiddling with Kooora's website for years trying to understand
the multiple aspects of the data they provide and had the idea of creating a public
API of it knocking around my head since at least 2017. The initial version of this
unofficial API was made possible by reverse-engineering Kooora's official Android
application both by reversing the code and by sniffing the network requests.
