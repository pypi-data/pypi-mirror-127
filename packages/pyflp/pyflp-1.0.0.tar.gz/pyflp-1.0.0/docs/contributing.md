# Contributing

PyFLP adheres to the [**Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct**](https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please make sure you have read it and accept it before proceeding further.

## Code Style: Black

PyFLP follows the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code style. It has a formatter. Make sure to use it.

## Code comments

At places in the code, you will see comments like this

```Python
# * Important
# ? Really
# ! Urgent
```

I recommend you to install [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) and use the appropriate formatting.

## Docstrings

The object model created by PyFLP is its core, ensure property docstrings are given wherever possible; however avoid redundant ones, along with other information like minimum, maximum limits and default. Also mention whether the default event linked to a property is stored or not. Currently PEP-257 attribute docstrings are used heavily and VS Code luckily supports them.

### When to document?

```Python
prop: int = IntProperty()
"""Doc doc doc. Min: min, Max: max, Default: default."""
```

Document properties when you satisfy either of the conditions:

- When you have some basic information other than the property name itself.
- When you have minimum, maximum and/or default values.

### When NOT to document?

```Python
color: colour.Color = ColorProperty()
"""Color."""
```

Don't document properties like name, color, index etc. if the property name itself is the only useful information available.
These properties occur throughout the object model that their meaning is pretty self-explanatory.

## Issues

You should begin with the [TODO](https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/blob/master/TODO.md).

## Testing

Currently, PyFLP has 2 tests, one tests `Event` classes and the other `Parser`; which parses an FLP from a ZIP and checks whethers the getters and parsing logic work properly. Setters and save logic still need tests, although I have included a basic null test to atleast guarantee that the event structure remains untouched unless setters are invoked.

### Running tests

Run tests with [`coverage.py`](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy)

```
coverage run -m pytest
```

!!! tip "Check coverage reports"
    ```
    coverage html
    ```

## Documentation

PyFLP uses MkDocs, the process to update it is fairly simple. Documentation is not versioned yet and I don't see the need to do it in the near future either. I used Sphinx earlier, but its love for reStructuredText makes it difficult to use.

## Changelog update

I am not using any tools to generate automated changelogs. Using [Keep A Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format.

## Pre-commit hooks

[Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) is used. Its configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/demberto/PyFLP/blob/master/.pre-commit-config.yaml)
