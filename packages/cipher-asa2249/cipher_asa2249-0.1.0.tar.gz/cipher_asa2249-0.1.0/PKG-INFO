# cipher_asa2249

A package for running Julius Caesar's cipher algorithm to encrypt and decrpyt text. This algorithm takes in 
an integer, shift, and a body of text, text, as well as a boolean for encrypt as
implicit parameters.

The integers shift determines the amount that each character is shifted in text.

For example, if shift = 3, and the word is 'cat', each letter will be shifted 3
to the right. Hence, 'cat' becomes 'fdw'.
