School research project
------------------------
I created this package for my school research project.
I want to create an AI that can predict if a human where to get a heart failure.
For this I created a very long python file but I wanted to make this easier to understand.
So, I created this package to get a shorter file and make it easier to understand.

How to use
--------------
This package uses the scikit-learn package and therefore some classes like the MLPRegressor are the same.

1. Import the package: "import zeroone_ai"
2. Choose wich class you are going to use: "from zeroone_ai import MLPRegressor
3. (More comming in the future)
