        # Child Growth Monitor Machine Learning
        
        [Child Growth Monitor (CGM)](https://childgrowthmonitor.org) is a game-changing app to detect malnutrition.
        If you have questions about the project, reach out to `info@childgrowthmonitor.org`.
        
        This is the Machine Learnine repository associated with the CGM project.
        
        ## Introduction
        
        This project uses machine learning to identify malnutrition from 3D scans of children under 5 years of age.
        This [one-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2doV43jdwg) explains.
        
        ## Getting started
        
        ### Requirements
        
        You will need:
        * Python 3.6 or Python 3.7
        * TensorFlow version 2
        * other libraries
        
        To install, run:
        
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        We use [Microsoft Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) to manage our datasets, experiments, and models internally.
        You can also run most of the code without AzureML though.
        
        ### Dataset access
        
        Data access is provided on as-needed basis following signature of the Welthungerhilfe Data Privacy & Commitment to
        Maintain Data Secrecy Agreement. If you need data access (e.g. to train your machine learning models),
        please contact [Markus Matiaschek](mailto:info@childgrowthmonitor.org) for details.
        
        If you have access to scan data, you can use: `cgmml/data_utils` to understand and visualize the data.
        
        ## Repository structure
        
        The source code is in `cgmml/`.
        
        Due to AzureML, all code for a single experiment run needs to reside in one directory.
        Example: All code for one specific training, e.g. a ResNet training, needs to be in this training directory.
        
        However, many of our trainings (and also evaluation runs) share large portions of code.
        In order to reduce code duplication, we copy shared(a.k.a. common) utility code with `copy_dir()` from `cgmml/common/` into the training/evaluation directory.
        This way, during the experiment run, the code is in the directory and can be used during the run.
        
        ### Run linting / tests
        
        ```bash
        # Make sure to be in the root dir of this repository
        flake8 cgmml/
        pytest
        ```
        
        ### Release cgm-ml-common
        
        Common functionalities of this repo are released on pypi: <https://pypi.org/project/cgm-ml-common/>
        
        To release a new version of cgm-ml-common:
        * Configure the version you wish to release in `setup.py`
        * Publish the release using the pipeline `.github/workflows/pypi-release.yml`
