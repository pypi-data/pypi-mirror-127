# Trame

Trame aims to be a framework for building interactive applications using a web front-end in plain Python. Such applications can be used locally as any desktop application but also be deployed in the cloud or on premise to access big and/or sensitive data.

Trame comes with lots of capabilities built-in by leveraging existing libraries or tools such as Vuetify, Altair, Vega, Deck, VTK, ParaView and more. Trame lets you create interactive data processing applications with rich visualizations without switching languages or technologies.

Trame lets you define your application in a very compact and intuitive way while letting you take over if you know better. Several available layouts let you build your application in no time.

Trame is the perfect companion to VTK or ParaView by offering various rendering and processing configurations. Trame lets you choose between server-side and client-side rendering along with hybrid approaches.

Please explore our gallery of examples for getting started.

Did you know that Trame is a French word with the following set of meanings:
- set of thread that are interlaced with each other to form a fabric
- the core of something that tigh things together (similar to a plot but more general)
- something that guide you by providing the core part of what you are doing

With this Open Source project we aim to help data scientists and researchers to solve their complex problems. And if need be we will be more than happy to team-up with you to help solve your next big idea.
