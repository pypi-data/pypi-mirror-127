Document API
---------------
The Document API provides a supported way to programmatically make updates to Tableau workbook and data source files. If you've been making changes to these file types by directly updating the XML--that is, by XML hacking--this SDK is for you :)

Features include:
- Support for 9.X, 10.X and 202x.x workbook and data source files
  - Including TDSX and TWBX files
- Getting connection information from data sources and workbooks
  - Server Name
  - Username
  - Database Name
  - Authentication Type
  - Connection Type
- Updating connection information in workbooks and data sources
  - Server Name
  - Username
  - Database Name
- Getting Field information from data sources and workbooks
  - Get all fields in a data source
  - Get all fields in use by certain sheets in a workbook

We don't yet support creating files from scratch, adding extracts into workbooks or data sources, or updating field information

As of 2021, this SDK no longer supports Python 2.
