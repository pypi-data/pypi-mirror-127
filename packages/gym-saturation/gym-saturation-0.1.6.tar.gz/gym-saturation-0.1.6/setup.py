Currently, only theorems written in [TPTP library](http://tptp.org) formal language in clausal normal form (CNF) are supported. `gym-saturation` implements the 'given clause' algorithm (similar to one used in [Vampire](https://github.com/vprover/vampire) and [E Prover](https://github.com/eprover/eprover)). Being written in Python, `gym-saturation` was inspired by [PyRes](https://github.com/eprover/PyRes). In contrast to monolithic architecture of a typical Automated Theorem Prover (ATP), `gym-saturation` gives different agents opportunities to select clauses themselves and train from their experience. Combined with a particular agent, `gym-saturation` can work as an ATP.\n\n`gym-saturation` can be interesting for RL practitioners willing to apply their experience to theorem proving without coding all the logic-related stuff themselves. It also can be useful for automated deduction researchers who want to create an RL-empowered ATP.\n\n# How to Install\n\nThe best way to install this package is to use `pip`:\n\n```sh\npip install gym-saturation\n```\n\nOne can also run it in a Docker container:\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t gym-saturation https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation.git\ndocker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 gym-saturation jupyter-lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --port=8888 --no-browser\n```\n\n# How to use\n\nSee [the notebook](https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/blob/master/examples/example.ipynb) or run it in [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/inpefess/gym-saturation/HEAD?labpath=example.ipynb) for more information.\n\n# How to Contribute\n\n[Pull requests](https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/pulls) are welcome. To start:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation\ncd gym-saturation\n# activate python virtual environment with Python 3.6+\npip install -U pip\npip install -U setuptools wheel poetry\npoetry install\n# recommended but not necessary\npre-commit install\n```\n\nAll the tests in this package are [doctests](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html). One can run them with the following command:\n\n```sh\npytest --doctest-modules gym-saturation\n```\n\nTo check the code quality before creating a pull request, one might run the script `show_report.sh`. It locally does nearly the same as the CI pipeline after the PR is created.\n\n# Reporting issues or problems with the software\n\nQuestions and bug reports are welcome on [the tracker](https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation/issues). \n\n# More documentation\n\nMore documentation can be found [here](https://gym-saturation.readthedocs.io/en/latest).\n",
