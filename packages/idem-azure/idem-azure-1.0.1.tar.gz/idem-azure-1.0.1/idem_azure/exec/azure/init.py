This file implements the vast majority of the Plugin Oriented Programming
(POP) exec Sub.

The basic operating model is building Subs as needed to match the nature of a
call to an exec. For example, a call like:

    hub.exec.azure.compute.virtual_machines.list(ctx, ...)

will work, even though no exec subdirectories exist to match that call path.
Instead, the classes herein dynamically build the POP Subs to match and tie
them to the appropriate Azure Python SDK wrappers within the tool Sub of this
project.

    valid Azure API without worrying that it is discovered a priori to the
    call. For example, calling on:

        hub.exec.azure.compute.virtual_machines.list(...)

    and later

        hub.exec.azure.compute.virtual_machines.get(...)

    requires the creation a DAG of Subs representing each attribute
    of the call paths.

    This class is the dict that allows the devleoper to write the callpath,
    fully assuming the call path DAG will get created as needed.
