This project enables `Idem <https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/idem>`__ users
to leverage `Microsoft Azure Resource Manager (ARM) <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/overview>`__
functionality to declare and enforce the state of cloud infrastructure,
applications, configurations, and more.

NOTE
====
Please use https://gitlab.com/vmware/idem/idem-azure-auto for all azure related items.
This project idem-azure has been deprecated and will remain as so.


About
=====

Microsoft Azure is a public cloud service that provides a broad array of,
among other things, compute, network and storage services. This
[Plugin Oriented Programming `POP <https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop>`__
implementation provides a plugin extension for Idem that enables declarative
state control of Azure resources.

This project is an early implementation of a modern POP plugin for ARM.
It does not yet cover all of Azure, in fact much work remains to do so. The
state of the project is a sufficient model to show how further
`POP Subs <https://pop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/subs_overview.html>`__
can be reasonably written and added to the project.

What is POP?
------------

This project is built with `pop <https://pop.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-based
implementation of *POP*. POP seeks to bring together concepts and wisdom from the
history of computing in new ways to solve modern computing problems.

* `Intro to Plugin Oriented Programming (POP) <https://pop-book.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
* `pop-awesome <https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop-awesome>`__
* `pop-create <https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/pop-create/>`__

Getting Started
===============

In order to use this plugin, a few prerequisites must be satisfied and the plugin must be
installed in an environment supporting the prerequisites..

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 3.6+; and
* git *(only if installing from source, or contributing to the project)*.

Installation
------------

To use ``idem-azure``, you can do so by either installing from PyPI or
from source.

Install via Pip
+++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install idem-azure

Install From Source
+++++++++++++++++++

.. code-block:: bash

   # clone the idem-azure repo
   git clone git@<your-project-path>/idem-azure.git
   cd idem-azure

   # Setup venv
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e .

Usage
=====

To use idem-azure, you must create a valid credentials dictionary, which is
passed to the POP `acct <https://gitlab.com/saltstack/pop/acct>`__ plugin. You
Then can use the Idem command line interface to interact with ARM.

Credentials with Acct
---------------------
Store your Azure credentials in a named file, for example myazurecreds.yaml
that you will encrypt and provide to Idem. Consider the following example.

.. code-block:: yaml

   azurerm:
      default:
         client_id: "abcdef-aabb-ccdd-eeff-aabbccddeeff"
         secret: "X2KRwdcdsQn9mwjdt0EbxsQR3w5TuBOR"
         subscription_id: "12345678-90ab-cdef-1234-567890abcdef"
         tenant: "cafe1234-0987-6543-210f-abcdefabcdef"

Then prepare the credentials by encrypting them for use by Idem via the
acct command line interface. The acct plugin will encrypt the file with the
Fernet algorithm.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ acct myazurecreds.yaml > myazurecreds.key


That will create two new files: an encrypted file at myazurecreds.yaml.fernet
and a file containing the decryption key at myazurecreds.key.

If desired, you can now remove the original myazurecreds.yaml file.

Keep the myazurecreds.key file safe as anyone with that file can use your
Azure account to create and use resources consistent with the policy attached
to the credentials.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ rm myazurecreds.yaml


To pass the credential information to the POP acct plugin, you can pass the
credentials via the Idem command line or via the environment. This example
sets up environment variables.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ export ACCT_KEY="$(cat /path/to/myazurecreds.key)"

Example State (SLS) File
------------------------
You can create a state file that declares the desired state of various Azure
resources. For example, `vm-create.sls <examples/vm-create.sls>`__ creates a
virtual machine with various network and disk attachments. The file
`vm-delete.sls <examples/vm-delete.sls>`__ deletes the same resources.

To create the virtual machine and supporting resources, you would issue a
command similar to that below.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ idem state examples/vm-create.sls

Note that Idem and POP implementations are both idempotent and asynchronous
in their operations. Therefore, you can run that same command multiple times
without harming the outcome intent of the state declarations.

To delete the virtual machine and related resources, you would issue a command
simillar to that below.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ idem state examples/vm-delete.sls

As noted above, POP plugins are asynchronous by nature, therefore some of the
state declarations may fail because Azure will refuse to delete certain
resources, such as subnets, when they are referenced by other resources, for
example virtual machines.

In order to reconcile the errors, run the command multiple times until all
state delarations produce no errors.
