# lscom

List and discover available COM ports.

Why? More quickly identify which COM ports are available for use. Any COM ports already in use will not be listed.

lscom should work cross platform (Linux, macOS, Windows), but has not been extensively tested.

## example

```
$ lscom
['COM3']
```
