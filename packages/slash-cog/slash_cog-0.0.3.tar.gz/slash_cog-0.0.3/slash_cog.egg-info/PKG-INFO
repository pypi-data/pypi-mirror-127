Description: # discord.py `/slash` cog
        **A drop-in vanilla discord.py cog that acts as a translation layer to add slash command support with little to no code modifications, no forks needed**

        ### Features:
        
         - Automatically generates a command map with argument listing for the entire bot
         - Wraps around existing discord.py `Context`, almost no code modifications needed
         - Automatic Multi-Instance bot detection (currently, it will only register if there is no shards or the bot runs *shard `0`*)
         - Storage-less automatic permissions syncing
        
        ### General TO-DOs & RFCs:
        
         - [ ] Make the cog more modular in order to support more customizations
         - [ ] Avoid monkey-patching command checks
         - [ ] Translation for `has_role`
        
        ### Unsupported Features (Unsupported by Discord):
        
         - [ ] Translation for Custom checks
         - [ ] Translation for `@commands.check_any()`
         - [ ] `is_nsfw` (commands currently hidden)
         - [ ] `*has_permissions` (only roles and user IDs are accepted)
         - [ ] `bot_has_(any)?_role`
         - [ ] `guild_only`
         - [ ] `dm_only`
        
        ### Fork Support:
        I personally won't provide support for forks as for simplicity's sake I will be basing this cog on [Rapptz/discord.py `master` v2.0.0a](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/master). However, fork-specific pull requests are allowed.
        
        A word though, because everyone is making their own forks of discord.py, I would suggest changing up the readme to include what changes and features the fork has added apart from API parity and maintenance just to make everybody's lives easier.
        
        ### 3-step Usage:
        Simply install the pip package with:
        ```shell script
        pip install -U slash_cog
        ```
        
        Then in your bot's cog loader, load the command handler (**CRITICAL:** Load it as the first extension as the cog needs to monkey patch command checks):
        ```python
        bot.load_extension("slash_cog")
        ```
        
        Create a new cog to register the commands globally or per-guild, you may copy [the example](examples/register_slash_commands.py).
        
        Preferably, you should only register the commands once and keep them registered as Discord will retain the command data unless you replace them, but the code for this is for you to decide and/or modify the example to.
