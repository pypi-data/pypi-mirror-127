Description: # elangai
        
        `elangai` is an inference engine platform designed for but not limited to the edge device. This SDK includes the main components of `elangai`.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        
        ### Prerequisite
        
        Before installing `elangai`, users have to install the following components:
        
        * TensorRT >= **7.0.0.11**
        * TensorFlow >= **2.5.0**
        * ONNXRuntime >= **1.5.2**
        
        Otherwise, `elangai` won't work as intended.
        
        
        ### Install

        ## Quick Guide
        
        
        ### Make Your Own AI App
        
        Using the following command on terminal, you could easily generate the AI app.
        
            elangai generate myapp
        
        
        ### Dissect Your AI Model
        
        Use the following command to examine the input and output tensor information of your AI model.
        
            elangai model-dissector /path/to/your/model.onnx
        
        
        Currently supports `.onnx` and `.tflite` file only.
        
        
        ### Convert Your AI Model to `.trt` File
        
        `elangai` only supports `.tflite` and `.trt` file inference. Use the following command to convert `.onnx` model to `.trt` file.
        
            elangai model-converter --src /path/to/model.onnx  --dst /path/to/model.trt
        
        
        Currently supports `.onnx` file conversion only.
