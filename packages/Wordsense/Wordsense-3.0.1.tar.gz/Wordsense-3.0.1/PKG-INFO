*Wordsense*
**---------------------------------------------------------------**

The whole idea of word sense is controversial.
The meaning of a word is highly contextual and depends on its usage in sentence.

English is very difficult language to learn by robot as
a lot of words are Ambiguous( Word with diffrent meanings).

To solve this state-of-the-art problem, we have implemented the solution using Knowledge-Based Method ,
which concerned with identifying which sense of a word is used in a sentence.

**How to Install**

```py
pip install Wordsense
```

**Demonstration**

```py
from wordSense import senses
sentence = 'I went to the bank to deposit my money' 
ambiguous_word = 'bank' 
print (Get_sense(sentence, ambiguous_word))
'a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities'
```
