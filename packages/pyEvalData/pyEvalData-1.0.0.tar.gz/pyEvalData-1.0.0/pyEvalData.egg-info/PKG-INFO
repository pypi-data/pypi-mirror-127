Description: # pyEvalData
        
        This is a Python module to evaluate experimental data, e.g. from large-scale
        facilities such as synchrotron or FELs.
        It is initially meant for reading SPEC data files and providing fundamental
        evaluation routines such as binning and uncertainty calculations, as well as
        fitting.
        
        In the former version also 1D and 2D input data was supported. This will be
        soon redone as well as reciprocal space transformations using xrayutilities.
