Description: # Distilbert-punctuator
        
        ## Introduction
        Distilbert-punctuator is a python package provides a bert-based punctuator (fine-tuned model of `pretrained huggingface DistilBertForTokenClassification`) with following three components:
        
        * **data process**: funcs for processing user's data to prepare for training. If user perfer to fine-tune the model with his/her own data.
        * **training**: training pipeline. User can fine-tune his/her own punctuator with the pipeline
        * **inference**: easy-to-use interface for user to use trained punctuator. If user doesn't want to train a punctuator himself/herself, a pre-fined-tuned model from huggingface model hub `Qishuai/distilbert_punctuator_en` can be used when launching the inference
        
        
        ## Data Process
        Component for pre-processing the training data. To use this component, please install as `pip install distilbert-punctuator[data_process]`
        
        The package is providing a simple pipeline for you to generate `NER` format training data.
        
        ### Example
        `examples/data_sample.py`
        
        ## Train
        Component for providing a training pipeline for fine-tuning a pretrained `DistilBertForTokenClassification` model from `huggingface`.
        
        ### Example
        `examples/train_sample.py`
        
        ## Inference
        Component for providing an inference interface for user to use punctuator.
        
        ### Architecture
        ```
         +----------------------+              (child process)
         |   user application   |             +-------------------+
         +                      + <---------->| punctuator server |
         |   +inference object  |             +-------------------+
         +----------------------+
        ```
        
        The punctuator will be deployed in a child process which communicates with main process through pipe connection.
        Therefore user can initialize an inference object and call its `punctuation` function when needed. The punctuator will never block the main process unless doing punctuation.
        There is a `graceful shutdown` methodology for the punctuator, hence user dosen't need to worry about the shutting-down.
