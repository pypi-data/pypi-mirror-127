dxutils -- Utils for DepX
================

This is a set of utilities which started as tools for internal use of our department.
At that time it was Department X (10) - of computational materials science.
The current name is different but the package name stucked. It turns out that the tools
may be os some use for other researchers and can be used in other programs.
They are centered around solid state computational physics.
