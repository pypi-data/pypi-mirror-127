Introduction
------------

Simple package/script to setup ``JSON`` logging for a Python app or script.
Uses `python-json-logger <https://github.com/madzak/python-json-logger>`__ and
is mostly just a wrapper around it. Instead of adding this script to every
Python module that I/you create you can just add this as a dependency and call:

.. code:: python

   from nialog import setup_module_logging, LoggingLevel

   # Default logging level is WARNING
   setup_module_logging()

   # LoggingLevel has enums for default logging module levels
   # Can be used with e.g. typer as command-line inputs
   LoggingLevel.DEBUG.value == "DEBUG"  # = True

Running tests
-------------

To run pytest in currently installed environment:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run pytest

To run test suite best suited for before pushing to e.g. GitHub.

.. code:: bash

   poetry run invoke prepush

To run full extensive test suite:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run invoke test

Formatting and linting
----------------------

Formatting and linting is done with a single command. First formats,
then lints.

.. code:: bash

   poetry run invoke format-and-lint

Building docs
-------------

Docs can be built locally to test that ``ReadTheDocs`` can also build them:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run invoke docs

Invoke usage
------------

To list all available commands from ``tasks.py``:

.. code:: bash

   poetry run invoke --list
