    name: Ensure that Cloud SQL database instances are not open to the world
    severity: major
    description: To minimize attack surface on a Database server instance, only trusted/known and required IP(s) should be allowedto connect to it. An authorized network should not have IPs/networks configured to 0.0.0.0/0 which will allow access to the instance from anywhere in the world. Note that authorized networks apply only to instances with public IPs.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that database connections are not permitted from 0.0.0.0/0.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_sql_database_instance resource, set the authorized Networks parameter under ipConfiguration subblock to value other than 0.0.0.0/0.
      console:  Follow the guide at <https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances> in order to audit and delete any authorized networks with 0.0.0.0/0.

    description: It is recommended to configure second generation sql instances to use private IPs and not public IPs to reduce the organization's attack surface.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the database instance configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that Google Cloud database instances have 'ipv4_enabled' attribute not set to true.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_sql_database_instance resources, ensure that ‘ipv4_enabled’ attribute is set to false for Google Cloud SQL database instances.
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/private-ip>  and <https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/orgpolicies/sql-restrictPublicIp>  in order to ensure that private IPs are used instead of public IPs.

    name: Ensure ‘Enable connecting to serial ports’ is not enabled for VM Instance
    severity: major
    description: The interactive serial console does not support IP-based access restrictions such as IP whitelists. 
      If the interactive serial console is enabled on an instance, clients can attempt to connect to that instance from any IP address.
      This allows unwanted access to that instance if they know the correct SSH key, username, project ID, zone, and instance name. 
      Hence interactive serial console support should be disabled.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the compute instances configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that metadata value for serial-port-enable is not set to true.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_compute_instance resource ensure the metadata serial-port-enable is not set to true (default is false).
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/interacting-with-serial-console> in order to disable the serial console access to the compute VM instance.

    name: Ensure Compute instances are launched with Shielded VM enabled
    severity: medium
    description: Shielded VMs are virtual machines (VMs) hardened by a set of security controls that help defend against rootkits and bootkits.
      Shielded VM instances run firmware which is signed and verified using Google's Certificate Authority,
      ensuring that the instance's firmware is unmodified and establishing the root of trust for secure boot.
      Shielded VM's verifiable integrity is achieved through the use of secure boot, virtual trusted platform module (vTPM), and integrity monitoring.
    human_readable_logic: Cloudrail will review the compute instances configuration within your GCP subscription and Terraform plan to ensure that the instances have Shielded VM attributes enabled.
    remediation_steps:
      terraform: For the google_compute_instance resource ensure the shielded_instance_config block has attributes enable_secure_boot, enable_vtpm and enable_integrity_monitoring set to true.
      console: Follow the guides at <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/modifying-shielded-vm> in order to turn on vTPM and integrity monitoring of VM instances.
