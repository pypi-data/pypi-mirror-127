It also include a full suite of tools for doing low-discrepancy\nsampling, quadrature creation, polynomial manipulations, and a lot more.\n\nThe philosophy behind ``chaospy`` is not to be a single tool that solves every\nuncertainty quantification problem, but instead be a specific tools to aid to\nlet the user solve problems themselves. This includes both well established\nproblems, but also to be a foundry for experimenting with new problems, that\nare not so well established. To do this, emphasis is put on the following:\n\n* Focus on an easy to use interface that embraces the `pythonic code style\n  <https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/style/>`_.\n* Make sure the code is "composable", such a way that changing one part of the\n  code with something user defined should be easy and encouraged.\n* Try to support a broad width of the various methods for doing uncertainty\n  quantification where that makes sense to involve ``chaospy``.\n* Make sure that ``chaospy`` plays nice with a large set of of other other\n  similar projects. This includes `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_, `scipy\n  <https://scipy.org/>`_, `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_,\n  `statsmodels <https://statsmodels.org/>`_, `openturns\n  <https://openturns.org/>`_, and `gstools <https://geostat-framework.org/>`_\n  to mention a few.\n* Contribute all code to the community open source.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstallation should be straight forward from `pip <https://pypi.org/>`_:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install chaospy\n\nOr if `Conda <https://conda.io/>`_ is more to your liking:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge chaospy\n\nThen go over to the `documentation <https://chaospy.readthedocs.io/en/master>`_\nto see how to use the toolbox.\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nChaospy uses `poetry`_ to manage its development installation. Assuming\n`poetry`_ installed on your system, installing ``chaospy`` for development can\nbe done from the repository root with the command:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    poetry install\n\nThis will install all required dependencies and chaospy into a virtual\nenvironment.\n\n.. _poetry: https://poetry.eustace.io/\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTo ensure that the code run on your local system, run the following:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    poetry run pytest --doctest-modules chaospy/ tests/\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation build assumes that ``pandoc`` is installed on your\nsystem and available in your path.\n\nTo build documentation locally on your system, use ``make`` from the ``docs/``\nfolder:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    cd docs/\n    make html\n\nRun ``make`` without argument to get a list of build targets.\nThe HTML target stores output to the folder ``doc/.build/html``.\n',
