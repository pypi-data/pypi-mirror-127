Python Cardano module
=====================

**This software is in development phase. Please consider it experimental and don't rely on any
API to be stable before version 1.0 comes.**

There's release 0.8 available. It is usable but more advanced features haven't been well tested
yet.

Prerequisites
-------------

1. You need to have a `cardano-node` running.
2. You need to have a `cardano-wallet` running and connected to the node.
3. The rest you find in the `documentation`_.

Please note it is most safe to run both node and wallet software on your local machine. The network
security is well beyond the scope of this documentation, though. Also, I strongly recommend using
the Cardano *testnet* for any software development and testing.

Roadmap
-------

This module is the implementation of `the idea`_ submitted to Catalyst Project.

**Q:** Why the roadmap above differs so much from the plan presented in Catalyst proposal?

**A:** While developing the module I discovered that some of the features I had originally declared
were impossible to implement given the available tools. Also, the proposal lacked some features
that are important but somehow I missed them when proposing. The roadmap consists of items I found
both important and doable.
