Active Learning
===============

Active Learning aims at creating training data for classification algorithms, in a very efficient manner,
for cases in which a large amount of unlabeled data is available but labels are not.
Labeling such data is usually time-consuming and expensive.
To avoid having to label the full dataset,
Active Learning selectively chooses data points that are assumed to improve the model.
This is done iteratively, in a process that alternates between an algorithm selecting data to label,
and a human annotator who assigns the true labels to given samples.
The goal here is to maximize the quality of the model while keeping the annotation efforts at a minimum.
A comprehensive introduction to Active Learning can be found in (Settles, 2010) [Set10]_.
