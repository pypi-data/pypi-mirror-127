[|LIBRARY_VERSION|]

`small-text` provides :doc:`active_learning` for Text Classification.
It is designed to offer a robust and modular set of components for both experimental and applied Active Learning.

Getting Started
===============

   data_structures

For now, the best way to get started is the `examples/ <https://github.com/webis-de/small-text/tree/master/examples>`_ folder in the github directory.

Active Learning Components
==========================

.. toctree::
   :caption: Components
   :maxdepth: 1
   :hidden:

   components/initialization
   components/query_strategies
   components/stopping_criteria

All components are based around the `ActiveLearner <https://github.com/webis-de/small-text/blob/master/small_text/active_learner.py>`_ class.
You can mix and match different many Initialization Strategies, Query Strategies and Classifiers.


Integrations
============

Optional Integrations allow you to use models from other libraries such as pytorch or transformers.

Common Patterns
===============

We provide patterns to common challenges when building experiments and/or applications,
such as :doc:`patterns/pool` and :doc:`patterns/serialization`.
