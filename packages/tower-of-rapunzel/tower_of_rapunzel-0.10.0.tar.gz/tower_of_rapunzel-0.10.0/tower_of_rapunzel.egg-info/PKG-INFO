Poster
======

Tower of Rapunzel is Free software. It is a web-native single-puzzle text adventure, built entirely of:

    * Python 3.7+
    * HTML5
    * CSS3

It's a piece of work to demonstrate the use of the `Turberfield dialogue`_ library, and to show how that
can be integrated into an asynchronous web framework.

Tower of Rapunzel's core logic is written in Python. The dialogue library provides a neat format to define and
schedule the speech of the non-player characters.

Other architectures are possible. Authors less focused on coding may prefer to implement game logic within
the dialogue itself. This too is supported by the `Turberfield dialogue`_ library.

I'm looking for feedback on the game and its underlying technology. Do please:

    * Leave a comment_ on the Itch.io game page
    * Flag a technical issue_ at the Github repository
