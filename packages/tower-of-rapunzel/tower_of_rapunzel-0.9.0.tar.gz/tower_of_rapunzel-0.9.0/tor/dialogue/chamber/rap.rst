[RAPUNZEL]_

    Rapunzel in the house; we are the best in town.

    And when we in the dance we gotta get-a-get down.

    And when we hear the Witch we-a let-a-let down.

    There ain't no MC can fake this sound.

    You took all the money.

    You baked it in a pie.

    There ain't nobody fabricate my vibe.

    Blonde's my colour, no paste nor dye.

[RAPUNZEL]_

    I get no stress from Trick or Treaters.

    And when I drink my juice I drink by litres.

    And when I brush my curls I brush by metres.

    Rapunzel in the club is a party completer.

[RAPUNZEL]_

    Did anybody tell you where your best friend went?

    She's hanging with my crew 'cos we're the more intelligent.

    And when we're at the gig we are the loudest in the tent.

    Rapunzel the original the 100%.
