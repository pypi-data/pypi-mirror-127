# latex-trim
Helps you include a sub-selection of a pdf into a latex document.

Simply run the script, e.g.
`latex-trim file.pdf <page_number>`,
and select a part of the page using the mouse, and press enter when done.

The script then outputs options to pass to `\includegraphics` in latex.

## Installation
```
pip install latex-trim
```
