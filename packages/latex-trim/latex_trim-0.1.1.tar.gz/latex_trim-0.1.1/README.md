# latex-includegraphics-trim
Helps you include a sub-selection of a pdf into a latex document.
Simply run the script, e.g.
`python3 latex-includegraphics-trim.py file.pdf <page_number>`,
and select a part of the page using the mouse, and press enter when done.
The script then outputs options to pass to `\includegraphics` in latex.
