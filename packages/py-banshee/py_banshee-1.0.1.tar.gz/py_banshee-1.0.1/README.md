# Py_BANSHEE
Bayesian Networks (BNs) are probabilistic, graphical models for representing complex dependency structures. They have many applications in science and engineering. Their particularly powerful variant – Non-Parametric BNs – are  implemented as an open-access scriptable code, in the form of a Python-based package.

The package allows for quantifying the BN, validating the underlying assumptions of the model, visualizing the network and its corresponding rank correlation matrix, sampling and finally making inference with a BN based on existing or new evidence. 

Py_BANSHEE  is a Python-based open source successor of the MATLAB toolbox [BANSHEE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.softx.2020.100588). 

## Installation and updating
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install Toolbox like below. 
Rerun this command to check for and install  updates .
```bash
pip install py-banshee
```

## Usage
Features:
* py_banshee.rankcorr.bn_rankcorr  --> Create a Bayesian Network rank correlation matrix 
* py_banshee.bn_plot.bn_visualize    --> Visualize the structure of a defined Bayesian Network
* py_banshee.copula_test.cvm_statistic      --> Goodness-of-fit test for copulas
* py_banshee.d_cal.gaussian_distance  --> Measure the distance between Gaussian densities
* py_banshee.sample_bn.generate_samples  --> Make samples using the defined Bayesian Network
* py_banshee.sample_bn.sample_base_conditioning --> Make samples based conditioning on intervals
* py_banshee.prediction.inference  --> Make predictions using a non-parametric Bayesian Network
* py_banshee.prediction.conditional_margins_hist  --> Visualize the un-conditional and conditional marginal histograms
