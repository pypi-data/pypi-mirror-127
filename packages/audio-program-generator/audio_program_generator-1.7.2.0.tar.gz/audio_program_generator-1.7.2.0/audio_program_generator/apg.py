Description:
    apg.py:
    (1) Generate audio program of spoken phrases, with optional background
    sound file mixed in.

    NOTE: the following instructions/guidelines apply to the command line
    interface only. Refer to the source code if you are importing this code
    as a module/package.

    User populates a semicolon-separated text file with plain-text phrases,
    each followed by an inter-phrase duration. Each line of the file is
    comprised of:
      - one phrase to be spoken
      - a semicolon
      - a silence duration (specified in seconds)
    Obviously, do not include superfluous semicolons in this file. An exception
    will occur if you do.

    The script generates and saves a single MP3 file. The base name of the
    file is the same as the specified input file. So, for example, if the
    script is given input file "phrases.txt", the output file will be
    "phrases.mp3".

    The CLI prints out a progress bar as the phrase file is converted into gTTS
    speech snippets. However, no progress bar is shown for the secondary mix
    step (when the optional sound_file parameter is specified). There can be a
    significant delay in going from the end of the first stage (snippet
    generation) to the end of the second stage (mixing), primarily because of
    reading in the .wav file. For this reason, you may want to select a sound
    file for mixing that is small (suggested <20MB). Otherwise, be prepared to
    wait. The progress bar may be disabled with the -n option.

    Specifying the optional sound_file parameter allows the user to mix in
    background sounds. This parameter represents the path/filename of a sound
    file to be mixed in with the speech file generated from the phrase file. If
    the sound file is shorter in duration than the generated speech file, it
    will be looped. If it is longer, it will be truncated. The resulting
    background sound (looped or  not) will be faded in and out to ensure a
    smooth transition. Currently, only .wav files are supported.

    Other options available include an attenuation parameter (dB0 applied to
    the mix-in sound file; a 'slow' flag, resulting slower speech; and a 'tld'
    option, allowing the user to select one of several regional 'accents'
    (English only). For accents, select one from the following list:
    ["com.au", "co.uk", "com", "ca", "co.in", "ie", "co.za"]
    See https://gtts.readthedocs.io/en/v2.2.3/module.html#localized-accents
    for full detils.

    Specifying option `--book-mode` creates a spoken-word program (with or without
    background soundfile). It does this by reading in a file that does not have
    inter-phrase durations inserted, as is normally the case. This feature is new
    and needs some tweaking. For now, just make sure your input file is pure text,
    and experiement with using a single line (with many sentences) as one paragraph
    vs. multiple lines, one per sentence. You wil notice a difference in how the
    'speaker' pauses between phrases.

Usage:
    apg [options] <phrase_file> [<sound_file>]
    apg -V --version
    apg -h --help

Options:
    -a --attenuation LEV    Set attenuation level of background file (non-
                            negative number indicating dB attenuation)
                            ([default: 0]).
    -s --slow               Generate speech at half-speed.
    -t --tld TLD            Top level domain (for regional accents); choose one:
                            ["com.au", "co.uk", "com", "ca", "co.in", "ie", "co.za"]
    -b --book-mode          From a plain text file, generate a reading of its contents
       --hide-progress-bar  Do not display progress bar during execution.
    -V --version            Show version.
    -h --help               Show this screen.

Arguments:
    phrase_file             Path/name of semicolon-separated text file
                            containing phrases and silence durations.
                            In book mode, the name of the all-text input file
                            to 'read'.
    sound_file              Path/name of optional wavefile to mix with the
                            speech generated from the phrase file. Useful for
                            background music/sounds. Must be in .wav format.

Example <phrase_file> format:
    Phrase One;2
    Phrase Two;5
    Phrase Three;0
