Description
---
A data processing tool offering hourly demand and flexibility profiles for future electric vehicle fleets in an aggregated manner.


Installation
---
Depending on if you want to use VencoPy or if you want to contribute, there are 
two different installation procedures described in VencoPy's documentation:

[I want to apply the tool](https://vencopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/installation.html#installation-for-users)

[I want to contribute to the codebase, the documentation or the tutorials](https://vencopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/installation.html#installation-for-developers)

In order to start using VencoPy, check out our [tutorials](https://vencopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/start.html#getting-started-and-tutorials). For this you won't need any additional data.

To run VencoPy in full mode, you will need the data set Mobilität in Deutschland (German for mobility in Germany). You
can request it here from the clearingboard transport: https://daten.clearingstelle-verkehr.de/order-form.html Currently, 
VencoPy is so far only tested with the B2 data set of MiD 2008 and MiD 2017.

Enjoy the tool, we're happy to receive feedback!
