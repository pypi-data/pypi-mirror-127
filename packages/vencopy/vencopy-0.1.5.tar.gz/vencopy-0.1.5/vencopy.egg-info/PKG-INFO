Description
---
A data processing tool offering hourly demand and flexibility profiles for future electric vehicle fleets in an aggregated manner.


Installation
---
Depending on if you want to use VencoPy or if you want to contribute, there are 
two different installation procedures described in VencoPy's documentation:

[I want to apply the tool](https://vencopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/installation.html#installation-for-users)

[I want to contribute to the codebase, the documentation or the tutorials](https://vencopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/installation.html#installation-for-developers)

In order to start using VencoPy, check out our [tutorials](https://vencopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/start.html#getting-started-and-tutorials). For this you won't need any additional data.

To run VencoPy in full mode, you will need the data set Mobilit√§t in Deutschland (German for mobility in Germany). You
can request it here from the clearingboard transport: https://daten.clearingstelle-verkehr.de/order-form.html Currently, 
VencoPy is so far only tested with the B2 data set of MiD 2008 and MiD 2017.

Enjoy the tool, we're happy to receive feedback!


Codestyle
---
We use PEP-8, with the exception of lowerCamelCase for method and variable names as well as UpperCamelCase for classes.
