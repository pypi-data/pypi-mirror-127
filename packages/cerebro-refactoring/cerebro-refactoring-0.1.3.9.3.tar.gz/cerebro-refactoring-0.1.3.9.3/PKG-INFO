# Cerebro Refactor Package
Refactoring is a systematic process of improving code without creating new functionality that can transform a mess into 
clean code and simple design.
<br><br>
Refactoring is a core package of [Cerebro](https://github.com/hieupth/cerebro) because we build everything with engineering mindset which means clean code and good 
software architect is our top concern.
<br><br>
We focus on the package in Python because it is our first programming language but we are working hard to make 
cross-platform support as soon as possible.
## Installation
The package can be installed by pip command:
```
pip install cerebro-refactoring
```
