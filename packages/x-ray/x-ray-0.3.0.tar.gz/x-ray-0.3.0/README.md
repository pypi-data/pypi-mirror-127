x-ray is a Python library for finding bad redactions in PDF documents.

## Why?

At Free Law Project, we collect millions of PDFs. An ongoing problem
is that people fail to properly redact things. Instead of doing it the right
way, they just draw a black rectangle or a black highlight on top of black
text and call it a day. Well, when that happens you just select the text under
the rectangle, and you can read it again. Not great.

After witnessing this problem for years, we decided it would be good to figure
out how common it is, so, with some help, we built this simple tool. You give
the tool the path to a PDF. It tells you if it has worthless redactions in it.


## What next?

Right now, `x-ray` works pretty well and we are using it to analyze documents
in our collections. It could be better though. Bad redactions take many forms.
See the issues tab for other examples we don't yet support. We'd love your
help solving some of tougher cases.


## Installation

With poetry, do:

```text
poetry add x-ray
```

With pip, that'd be:
```text
pip install x-ray
```

## Usage

You can easily use this on the command line. Once installed, just:

```bash
% python -m xray path/to/your/file.pdf
{
  "1": [
    {
      "bbox": [
        58.550079345703125,
        72.19873046875,
        75.65007781982422,
        739.3987426757812
      ],
      "text": "The Ring travels by way of Cirith Ungol"
    }
  ]
}
```

That'll give you json, so you can use it with tools like [`jq`][jq]. The format is as follows:

 - It's a dict.
 - The keys are page numbers.
 - Each page number maps to a list of dicts.
 - Each of those dicts maps to two keys.
 - The first key is `bbox`. This is a four-tuple that indicates the x,y positions of the upper left corner and then lower right corners of the bad redaction.
 - The second key is `text`. This is the text under the bad rectangle.

Simple enough.

If you want a bit more, you can use `x-ray` in Python:

```python
from pprint import pprint
import xray
bad_redactions = xray.inspect("some/path/to/your/file.pdf")
pprint(bad_redactions)
{1: [{'bbox': (58.550079345703125,
               72.19873046875,
               75.65007781982422,
               739.3987426757812),
      'text': 'Aragorn is the one true king.'}]}
```

The output is the same as above, except it's a Python object, not a JSON object.

If you already have the file contents as a `bytes` object, that'll work too:

```python
some_bytes = requests.get("https://lotr-secrets.com/some-doc.pdf").content
bad_redactions = xray.inspect(some_bytes)
```

Note that because the `inspect` method uses the same signature no matter what,
the type of the object you give it is essential. So if you do this, `xray` will
assume your file name (provided as bytes) is file contents and it won't work:

```python
xray.inspect(b"some-file-path.pdf")
```

That's pretty much it. There are no configuration files or other variables to
learn. You give it a file name. If there is a bad redaction in it, you'll soon
find out.


## How it works

Under the covers, `x-ray` uses the high-performant [PyMuPDF project][mu] to parse PDFs.

You can read the source to see how it works, but the general idea is to:

1. Find rectangles in the PDF.

2. Find letters that are under those rectangles.

Things get tricky in a couple places:

 - letters without [ascenders][asc] are taller than they seem and might not be entirely under the rectangle
 - drawings in PDFs can contain multiple rectangles
 - text under redactions can be on purpose (like if it says "XXX" or "privileged", etc)
 - text on top of rectangles is very common in forms, so we use the draw order of the PDF to detect this

And so forth. We do our best.


## Contributions

Please see the issues list on Github for things we need, or start a conversation if you have questions. Before you do your first contribution, we'll need a signed contributor license agreement. See the template in the repo.


## Deployment

Releases happen automatically via Github Actions. To trigger an automated build:

1. Update the version in pyproject.toml

2. Tag the commit with something like "v0.0.0".


If you wish to create a new version manually, the process is:

1. Update version info in `pyproject.toml`

2. Configure your Pypi credentials [with Poetry][creds]

3. Build and publish the version:

```sh
poetry publish --build
```
