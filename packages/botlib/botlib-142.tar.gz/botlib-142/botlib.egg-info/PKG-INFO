Description: BOTLIB
        ######
        
        **BOTLIB** is an attempt to achieve OS level integration of bot technology
        directly into the operating system. A solid, non hackable bot, that runs
        under systemd and rc.d as a 24/7 background service that starts the
        bot after reboot, stores it's data as JSON files on disk, every object is
        timestamped, readonly of which the latest is served to the user layer. This
        bot is intended to be programmable in a static, only code, no popen, no
        imports and no reading modules from a directory, way that **should** make
        it suitable for embedding.
        
        configuration
        =============
        
        configuration is done by calling the bot as a cli, bot <cmd> allows you to
        run bot commands on a shell, configuration uses the cfg command to edit 
        configuration on disk. 
        
        irc
        ---
        
        IRC configuration is done with the use of the botctl program, the cfg
        command configures the IRC bot.
        
        ::
        
         bot cfg server=<server> channel=<channel> nick=<nick> 
        
        default channel/server is #botd on localhost
        
        sasl
        ----
        
        some irc channels require SASL authorisation (freenode,libera,etc.) and
        a nickserv user and password needs to be formed into a password. You can use
        the pwd command for this
        
        ::
        
         bot pwd <nickservnick> <nickservpass>
        
        after creating you sasl password add it to you configuration.
        
        ::
        
         bot cfg password=<outputfrompwd>
        
        users
        -----
        
        if you want to restrict access to the bot (default is disabled), enable
        users in the configuration and add userhosts of users to the database.
        
        ::
        
         bot cfg users=True
         bot met <userhost>
        
        rss
        ---
        
        if you want rss feeds in your channel install feedparser.
        
        ::
        
         sudo apt install python3-feedparser
        
        add a url to the bot and the feed fetcher will poll it every 5 minutes.
        
        ::
        
         bot rss <url>
        
        24/7
        ----
        
        if you want to bot to restart after reboot, enable the botd service:
        
        ::
        
         sudo cp /usr/local/share/botd/botd.service /etc/systemd/system
         sudo systemctl enable botd --now
        
        the botd program uses botc as it's cli for configuration, botctl is
        a systemd wrapper around it. depending on rc.d or systemd choose one of
        those.
