# pyazureutils
pyazureutils is a collection of utilities for interacting with Microsoft Azure Web Services.

## Usage
pyazureutils is intended as a library as well as a stand-alone CLI.
Its primary consumer is iotprovision.
The CLI requires that the Azure CLI ('az') is installed.

## Command-line interface
pyazureutils CLI is invoked with one command, one action and optional switches.  See help and examples below for more details. 

Getting help:
```
pyazureutils --help
````

Getting command-specific help (iotcentral command):
```
pyazureutils iotcentral --help
````

### iotcentral command
The iotcentral command supports device registration with Azure IoT Central

Example:
```
pyazureutils iotcentral register-device
```
Device registration can optionally include the switches:
```
--application-name <application name to register with>
--display-name <display name to use for the device registration>
--certificate-file <certificate to use for registration, if not read from a kit>
```

## Library
pyazureutils can be used as a library by instantiating any of the contained classes.

For example to perform provisioning for Azure IoT:
```
# pyazureutils uses the Python logging module
import logging
logging.basicConfig(format="%(levelname)s: %(message)s", level=logging.WARNING)

# The target must be running provisioning firmware, pykitcommander is used to accomplish this.
# It locates the bundled firmware for the function requested, programs it onto the MCU on the kit
# and returns a protocol object and port for communicating with the application
from pykitcommander.kitprotocols import get_protocol
protocol, port = get_protocol("iotprovision-azure")

# Instantiate the provisioner
from pyazureutils.custom_provision import AzureCustomProvisioner
provider_provisioner = AzureCustomProvisioner("my_signer_ca_key_file",
                                              "my_signer_ca_cert_file",
                                              "generated_device_csr_file",
                                              "generated_device_cert_file")

# Do the actual provisioning
device_id = provider_provisioner.provision(protocol, port)
```
The above example will generate a device certificate and save it along with the CA signer certificate in WINC flash. Generated certificates and Device ID are saved to files as well.

## Logging
This package uses the Python logging module for publishing log messages to library users.

A basic configuration can be used (see example), but for best results a more thorough configuration is recommended in order to control the verbosity of output from dependencies in the stack which also use logging.

## Dependencies
This package uses pyedbglib through other libraries for USB communications.  For more information see: https://pypi.org/project/pyedbglib/.

## Versioning
pyazureutils version can be determined by:
```
from pyazureutils.version import VERSION as pyazureutils_version
print("pyazureutils version {}".format(pyazureutils_version))
```
