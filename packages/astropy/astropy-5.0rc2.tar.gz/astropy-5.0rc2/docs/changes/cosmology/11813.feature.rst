Add equality operator for comparing Cosmology instances. Comparison is done on
all immutable fields (this excluded 'meta').

Now the following will work:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from astropy.cosmology import Planck13, Planck18
    >>> Planck13 == Planck18
    False

    >>> Planck18 == Planck18
    True
