Positions for the Moon using the 'builtin' ephemeris now use the new
``erfa.moon98`` function instead of our own implementation of the Meeus
algorithm. As this also corrects a misunderstanding of the frame returned by
the Meeus, this improves the agreement with the JPL ephemeris from about 30 to
about 6 km rms.
