Allow negation, multiplication and division also of representations that
include a differential (e.g., ``SphericalRepresentation`` with a
``SphericalCosLatDifferential``).  For all operations, the outcome is
equivalent to transforming the representation and differential to cartesian,
then operating on those, and transforming back to the original representation
(except for ``UnitSphericalRepresentation``, which will return a
``SphericalRepresentation`` if there is a scale change).
