In docstrings, Sphinx cross-reference targets now use intersphinx, even if the
target is an internal link (``link`` is now ``'astropy:link``).
When built in Astropy these links are interpreted as internal links. When built
in affiliate packages, the link target is set by the key 'astropy' in the
intersphinx mapping.
