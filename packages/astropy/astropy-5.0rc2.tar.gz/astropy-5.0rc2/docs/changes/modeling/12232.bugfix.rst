Minor bugfixes and improvements to modeling including the following:
    * Fixed typos and clarified several errors and their messages throughout
      modeling.
    * Removed incorrect try/except blocks around scipy code in
      ``convolution.py`` and ``functional_models.py``.
    * Fixed ``Ring2D`` model's init to properly accept all combinations
      of ``r_in``, ``r_out``, and ``width``.
    * Fixed bug in ``tau`` validator for the ``Logarithmic1D`` and
      ``Exponential1D`` models when using them as model sets.
    * Fixed ``copy`` method for ``Parameter`` in order to prevent an
      automatic ``KeyError``, and fixed ``bool`` for ``Parameter`` so
      that it functions with vector values.
    * Removed unreachable code from ``Parameter``, the ``_Tabular`` model,
      and the ``Drude1D`` model.
    * Fixed validators in ``Drude1D`` model so that it functions in a
      model set.
    * Removed duplicated code from ``polynomial.py`` for handing of
      ``domain`` and ``window``.
    * Fixed the ``Pix2Sky_HEALPixPolar`` and ``Sky2Pix_HEALPixPolar`` modes
      so that their ``evaluate`` and ``inverse`` methods actually work
      without raising an error.
