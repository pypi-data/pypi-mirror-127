Adds a new method ``earth_rotation_angle`` to calculate the Local Earth Rotation Angle.
Also adjusts Local Sidereal Time for the Terrestrial Intermediate Origin (``TIO``)
and adds a rigorous correction for polar motion. The ``TIO`` adjustment is approximately
3 microseconds per century from ``J2000`` and the polar motion correction is at most
about +/-50 nanoseconds. For models ``IAU1982`` and ``IAU1994``, no such adjustments are
made.
