## Typing stubs for PyYAML

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `PyYAML` package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like mypy, PyCharm, pytype etc. to check code
that uses `PyYAML`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/master/stubs/PyYAML. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/master/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `59408d9c9cd1d25e4083707893a1b2f2965c2c0a`.
