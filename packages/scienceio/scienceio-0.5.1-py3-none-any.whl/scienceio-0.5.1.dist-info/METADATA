# ScienceIO

The official ScienceIO Python SDK for the ScienceIO API.

This package is available via [Pypi:scienceIO](https://pypi.org/project/scienceio/). View full documentation at [ScienceIO Docs](https://docs.science.io/docs).


## Usage and examples

1. Create a ScienceIO API key. Both the API key ID and the key secret will be
needed in order to set up the ScienceIO Python SDK for use.

2. Install the ScienceIO Python SDK.

   ```python
   pip install scienceio
   ```

3. Create a directory `.scienceio` in your home directory (Mac users, your home directory is `/Users/{username}`. Linux users, your home directory is `/home/{username}`. Windows users, your home directory is `C:\\Users\{username})` Inside this directory, create a text file called `config` containing your credentials:

   ```
   [SETTINGS]
   KEY_ID={your ScienceIO API key ID}
   KEY_SECRET={your ScienceIO API key secret}
   ```

4. Use the ScienceIO Python SDK to annotate text:

   ```python
   scio = ScienceIO()
   query_text = (
     'The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a markedly low proportion of '
     'cases among children 1â€“4. Age disparities in observed cases could be '
     'explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower '
     'propensity to show clinical symptoms or both.'
   )

   results = scio.annotate(query_text)
   print(results)
   ```
